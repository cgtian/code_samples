README
+ The code in this repository is from my time at the NYC Department of Education.
+ I have the written approval of my former supervisor to share these samples publicly.
+ My coding style has shifted somewhat (with an eye towards maintainability)
  since I left the DOE. Nevertheless, I hope these work samples give the reader
  a general sense of my ability in SQL.
