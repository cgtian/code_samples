README
+ The code in this repository is from my time at the NYC Department of Education.
+ I have the written approval of my supervisor to share these samples publicly.
+ My coding style has shifted somewhat (with an eye towards maintainability and performance)
  since I left the DOE. Nevertheless, as the most recent projects that I can share
  publicly, I hope these samples give the reader a general sense of my ability in SQL.
