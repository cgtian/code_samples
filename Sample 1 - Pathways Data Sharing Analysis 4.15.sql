pathways data sharing analysis for april 2015

description
this analysis measures the immediate impact of the newly legislated pathways exam requirements on hs seniors' prospects for graduation
(i.e. how many hs seniors who previously did not meet exam requirements to graduate now meet the new pathways exam requirements?)

code outline
[1] active 12th graders plus their biographical information

[2] best exam performances plus counts of exams above various thresholds for each student in the above population (who have any)
	[2a] exams for each student
	[2b] best stem exam performance in a subject_detail besides the two associated with the student's highest math and science exams
		[2bi] indexes by studentid_subject and studentid_subject_detail for stem exams
		[2bii] best stem exam performance in a subject_detail besides the two associated with the student's highest math and science exams
	[2c] best exam performances for each student
	[2d] counts of exams above various thresholds for each student
	[2e] exams away from meeting local exam requirements via compensatory score option for each student
	[2f] best exam performances plus counts of exams above various thresholds for each student

[3] students who are one social studies exam away from meeting exam requirements
	[3a] students who are one social studies exam away from meeting exam requirements for an advanced regents diploma
	[3b] students who are one social studies exam away from meeting exam requirements for a regents diploma
	[3c] students who are one social studies exam away from meeting exam requirements for a local diploma (assuming future exams result in scores between 55 and 64 inclusive)
		[3ci] students who meet exam requirements for a local diploma
		[3cii] students who are one social studies exam away from meeting exam requirements for a local diploma (assuming future exams result in scores between 55 and 64 inclusive)
	
[4] best exam performances for students who were one social studies exam away from meeting exam requirements pre-pathways who now meet exam requirements using the stem regents pathway
